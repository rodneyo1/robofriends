# RoboFriends

RoboFriends is a React app that lets you search between different API generated robots by name. 


This app integrates with a robot's API to fetch random robot images by searching them and display them on the website. It is created using React, and utlizes the Robohash and JSONPlaceholder APIs to create a series of contact cards with unique robot avatars for a sample list of contacts/friends. Additionally, the Tachyons CSS toolkit is used for quick styling. The application featured contact cards that displayed the contact's name and email, as well as an avatar.
